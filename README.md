# Population Exposure to Extreme Heat Days in Africa


This repository documents the procedure used to develop maps of climate heat indicators for Africa based on [CORDEX AFR-22](https://cordex.org/experiment-guidelines/cordex-cmip5/cordex-core/cordex-core-simulations/) data.

We follow the workflow described in the paper:

*Weber, T., Bowyer, P., Rechid, D., Pfeifer, S., Raffaele, F., Remedio, A. R., et al. (2020). Analysis of compound climate extremes and exposed population in Africa under two different emission scenarios. Earth's Future, 8, e2019EF001473. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EF001473*


## Ingredients:

### Climate Index

For the calculation of the number of extrem heat days (maximum temperature > 40Â°C) we use the [index_calculator](https://github.com/climate-service-center/index_calculator). This is using [xclim](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim)


### Environment

    conda env create -f afrheat.yml

    conda activate afrheat


### Future Population

The information about the [population](population.md) data source. 

With the following Notebook you can remap the population files and calculate the country sum .

    Notebooks/remap_population_to_afr22.ipynb
    Notebooks/country_sum_population_to_afr22.ipynb

### Exposure

The change of population and the climate change signal for specific indicators are combined. [Literature](exposure.md)

The exposure of the population to extreme heat days is calculated in the next Notebook.

$\Delta E = P_r \times \Delta C + C_r \times \Delta P + \Delta C \times \Delta P$

### Exposure calculation and plotting

The following Notebook produces the horizontal exposure maps for ssp1/rcp2 and ssp3/rcp85 of population to extrem heat days. The plots show the timeslice  1991-2024 and 2031-2060 as well as its future changes.
