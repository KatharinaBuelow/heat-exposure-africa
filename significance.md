# Calculation of Significance and Robustness of Climate Change

A climate model ensemble is used to account for uncertainty in the projections and to increase the robustness of the results.

Uncertainties in climate modeling arise from the complexity of the climate system and its interactions, the necessary simplifications of climate processes in models (due to computational limitations requiring numerical parameterization), natural climate variability, and assumptions about future developments in greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols, and land use.

The statistical significance of climate change is calculated for each individual climate simulation. This is done using a statistical test that assesses whether a given change is strong enough to exceed random (natural) variability. Climate change is considered statistically significant if, according to the Mann-Whitney U test, there is less than a 5% probability that the observed change can be explained by random fluctuations.

## Expert Assessment

The results of the selected model ensemble are evaluated for both statistical significance and robustness. The calculations were performed using xclim.

##Robust Increase:## At least two-thirds of the simulations show an increase, and at least 50% of the simulations show a statistically significant increase.

##Robust Decrease:## At least two-thirds of the simulations show a decrease, and at least 50% of the simulations show a statistically significant decrease.

##Tendency Toward Increase:## At least two-thirds of the simulations show an increase, but fewer than 50% show a statistically significant increase.

##Tendency Toward Decrease:## At least two-thirds of the simulations show a decrease, but fewer than 50% show a statistically significant decrease.

##Unclear:## No two-thirds majority in the direction of change, but at least 50% of the simulations show statistically significant changes.

##No Change:## No two-thirds majority in the direction of change, and fewer than 50% of the simulations show statistically significant changes.
